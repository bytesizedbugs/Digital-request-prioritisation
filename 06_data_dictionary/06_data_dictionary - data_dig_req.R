# Data Dictionary — data_dig_req
#
# Uses {pointblank} to create and maintain a data dictionary (informant object)
# for the data_dig_req table.
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Run prerequisite wrangling script to create data_dig_req.
#   2. Run this script to (re)generate the informant and write the YAML.
#   3. Commit the updated YAML file to version control.
#
# Output: 03_data_dictionary/data_dig_req.yml
#
# See: https://rstudio.github.io/pointblank/articles/INFO-1.html
# IMPORTANT: The output YAML must not contain patient identifiable information.
